## About Me

I’m transitioning into **IT Support and Cloud Operations** after over a decade running high-pressure operational roles where **problem-solving, communication, and reliability were non-negotiable**.  

I’m self-taught in AWS, Windows & Linux administration, networking basics, Python automation, and CloudOps workflows. I build hands-on labs to **simulate real incidents**, troubleshoot them, and automate responses—documenting everything on GitHub.  

I’m seeking **entry-level to intermediate cloud support or IT support roles**, where my operational experience meets my technical skills to drive real results.

**My goal:** Break into Cloud/IT support, grow fast, and eventually leverage skills for **investments in real estate** for long-term financial freedom.

**No shortcuts. No hype. Just consistent learning and execution.**
