## 👋 About This Project

Hands-on AWS lab simulating real-world CloudOps troubleshooting scenarios. Built to practice deploying, monitoring, and fixing multi-tier web applications in a controlled environment before touching production systems.

**What this demonstrates:**
- Deploying multi-tier AWS infrastructure (web, app, database layers)
- Simulating realistic operational failures and troubleshooting them
- Building monitoring pipelines and automated alerts
- Documenting incident response workflows

This isn't production infrastructure—it's a safe training ground for building CloudOps muscle memory.

## 🏗️ Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](diagrams/Multi-Tier_Diagram.png)

**Components:**
- **Frontend:** EC2 instances serving web tier
- **Backend:** EC2 instances running application logic
- **Database:** RDS instance for data persistence
- **Networking:** VPC with public/private subnets, security groups, routing tables
- **Load Balancing:** ELB distributing traffic across frontend instances
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch dashboards, alarms, and logs

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

**Result:** Full multi-tier environment deployed (EC2, RDS, VPC, subnets, load balancer)

### 2. Verify Connectivity

- Test EC2 SSH access and security group rules
- Confirm routing table configurations
- Validate IAM role permissions

**Result:** Baseline operational state confirmed

### 3. Launch Application

- Start frontend services on web tier EC2 instances
- Start backend services on app tier EC2 instances
- Verify database connectivity from app tier

**Result:** Working multi-tier application

### 4. Run Troubleshooting Scenarios

Simulated failures include:
- **EC2 instance failure:** Instance stops responding, diagnose and recover
- **IAM permission errors:** App can't access RDS due to misconfigured roles
- **Database connection failures:** RDS security groups blocking app tier access
- **Load balancer health check failures:** ELB marking instances unhealthy
- **Network routing issues:** Subnet routing tables misconfigured

Each scenario includes problem description, symptoms, troubleshooting steps, root cause analysis, and resolution documentation.

**Result:** Hands-on experience diagnosing and fixing real-world AWS issues

### 5. Monitoring & Automation

- CloudWatch dashboards tracking key metrics
- Automated alerts via SNS for threshold breaches
- CI/CD workflows for infrastructure deployment
- Python scripts for health checks and validation

**Result:** Operational observability and automation practice
